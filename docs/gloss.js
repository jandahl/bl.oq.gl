 * translation fragment rather than a distinct grammatical category
 * (bl-oq-ly#12). Split it back out. `gloss` uses "label: rest" (the raw

 * threads each stem/affix's contribution through fillStemSlot's "___"
 * substitution (stemIn/stemOut), so the final item's `gloss` is the whole
 * sentence, not just its own piece. A single composed sentence, unlike a
 * per-morpheme row list, isn't meaningfully "reversible" -- the
 * European-reading-order toggle (bl-oq-ly#11) never applies here, only to
