// ever exercises a frozen local snapshot would never catch that class of
// break, which is the single most likely source of regression given both
// upstreams' explicit no-stability-promise posture. The tradeoff is a real
// one (CI can go red for reasons outside this repo's own commits) — accepted
// deliberately, not overlooked.
